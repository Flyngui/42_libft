Things to do:

check functions one by one for correct returns (if supposed to return size_t then must return size_t)

check functions for overflow protections / other protections in the original funcions, must replicate those

make sure function prototypes are the same in the function and libft.h

remove "wildcard" from Makefile, replace with explicit name of every .c file
